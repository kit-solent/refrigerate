class_name Player extends RigidBody2D
## A player is an in-game entity controlled by either the local user or a remote
## player. Note that this class is not a functional player by itself and the player
## scene should be used instead. i.e. use load("res://core/player/player.tscn") instead of Player.new().
## This class can be used to access the data ascociated with players such as the modes enum or
## mode_transforms dictionary.

enum modes {TopDown, ## The player can move in any direction and there is no gravity.
			PlatformerDown, ## Gravity acts down.
			PlatformerLeft, ## Gravity acts to the left.
			PlatformerUp, ## Gravity acts up.
			PlatformerRight ## Gravity acts to the right.
}

enum topdown_options {
	EightDirectional, ## The player always faces upwards and uses the 4 movment keys to move around.
	TurnAndMove, ## The player uses the left and right movment keys to turn and the forward and backward keys to move.
	Mouse ## The player always faces the mouse and can move left/right/up/down using the movment keys.
}

## These are the Transform2Ds for the 5 modes.
## They are used for gravity, jump, and movment 
## calculations so the TopDown transform should
## nullify any vectors to which it is applied.
